This is a basic Flask application that demonstrates how to integrate **MySQL**, **Flask-SQLAlchemy** for database interaction, and **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for authentication. The application allows users to register, log in, and retrieve information about their subscription plans based on their roles.

 ## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
 ~~~bash
   git clone https://github.com/mscbuild/User_story_use-case.git
 ~~~

2 Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
~~~bash
python -m venv venv
~~~

3.Activate the virtual environment:

- Windows:
~~~bash
venv\Scripts\activate
~~~
- MacOS/Linux:
~~~bash
  source venv/bin/activate
~~~
4.Install the required dependencies:
~~~bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~
5.You will need a MySQL database for the application. Follow the steps below to set it up.

# ‚úÖ Setup MySQL Database

- Install MySQL on your local machine if you haven't already. You can download it from here.

- Create a database named flask_db (or any name you prefer) and the following tables:

 3. Update the SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI in app.py to reflect your MySQL credentials:
~~~bash
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'mysql+mysqlconnector://username:password@localhost/flask_db'
~~~
4. Run the application.

# ‚ú® Running the Application

- Make sure MySQL is running and your database is set up as described above.

- Run the Flask application:
  ~~~bash
  python app.py
~~~
- The application will be running at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

- Use an API testing tool like Postman or cURL to interact with the API.

# üîÄ Example: Register a User

***POST /register***

~~~bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/register -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username": "john_doe", "password": "password123", "role": "premium"}'
